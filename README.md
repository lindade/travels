# travels

Webpage for booking travel tours implemented with advanced CSS3 (Sass) and HTML5, using npm packages and a custom made responsive float layout.

## npm run compile:sass
runs the script
```node-sass sass/main.scss css/style.css -w```
from the package.json. It will start watching the scss file and generate the css file after each save. Keep the terminal open and running. Use a new terminal for other commands.

## live-server

Enter the command ```live-server``` in a seperate terminal. It will start a live view of the index.html file and reload it after each saved change.
